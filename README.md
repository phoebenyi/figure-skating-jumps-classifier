## Project Overview  ‚õ∏
Figure Skating Classifier using TensorFlow 


## Project Description  ‚õ∏

Differentiating between the six figure skating jumps‚ÄîToe Loop, Salchow, Loop, Flip, Lutz, and Axel‚Äîcan be challenging for newcomers to the sport. These jumps are often integrated into fast-paced routines, making visual differentiation even harder.

As a figure skating and AI/ML enthusiast, I developed a CNN machine learning model utilizing TensorFlow and Keras to classify these jumps using 3D pose data from the FS-Jump3D dataset.

This ML model aims to differentiate between Toe Loop, Salchow, Loop, Flip, Lutz, Axel and Combination jumps.


## Note: (for curious people :p)  ‚õ∏

- Salchow     -  Backward inside edge

- Loop        -  Backward outside edge

- Flip        -  Backward inside edge, with toe-pick

- Lutz        -  Backward outside edge, with toe-pick, landing on the opposite foot

- Toe Loop    -  Backward outside edge, with toe-pick, landing on the same foot

- Axel        -  Forward outside edge, with an additional half rotation in the air (a single Axel consists of one and a half rotation)


## Dataset Information   üßÆ
FS-Jump3D Dataset provides detailed 3D pose data of skaters performing different jumps and captures key body movements through markerless motion capture technology. This makes it ideal for analyzing complex 3D movements and subtle technical differences between jumps, such as take-off angles, rotation, and landing positions, which are critical for classifying each type of jump accurately.

## Personal Learning Notes  üìù

Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are both types of neural networks used in deep learning, but they have different architectures and are suited for different types of tasks.

Initially, I decided to build a DNN machine learning model for classifying the 6 different types of figure skating jumps because DNN are oftenly used for classification. However, I got a low test accuracy of 10-20% because DNNs lack the ability to capture the spatial and temporal structure inherent in figure skating jumps, as they treat all input features independently.

Therefore, I decided to build a CNN machine learning model because CNNs work better with handling spatial and sequential data, as they capture local patterns and relationships that DNNs cannot effectively manage without an enormous amount of data. The CNN‚Äôs architecture, especially its convolutional and pooling layers, allows it to pick up essential spatial features, making it particularly well-suited for visual and temporal data, like movements in figure skating jumps. In the end, I got a test accuracy of 86.96%.
